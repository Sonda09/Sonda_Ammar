                         <h5>Exploring possibilistic fingerprint image quality analysis: a soft computing approach for biometric database management</h5>
                         <p>One of the main challenges in fingerprint recognition lies in assessing and ensuring the quality of fingerprint images used in biometric systems. In this paper, we address this challenge by focusing on the construction of a high-quality fingerprint database and leveraging it to validate a novel quality assessment approach. Our primary contribution lies in the development of a comprehensive database explicitly labeled with ground truth on fingerprint image quality, ensuring reliable data. This database serves as a benchmark resource for the biometric community, facilitating standardized evaluation and comparison. Building upon this dataset, we introduce an innovative two-level possibilistic modeling framework for fingerprint image quality assessment. At the first level, local quality indicators are modeled using possibility distributions, effectively capturing uncertainties in image quality assessment. The second level aggregates these local indicators into a global quality score, providing a holistic and flexible representation of fingerprint image quality. To further enhance the robustness of our approach, we introduce discriminative quality indicators that capture subtle variations in fingerprint image quality and employ a sensitivity-aware feature selection process. The effectiveness of our framework is rigorously validated using our newly constructed database, demonstrating its capability to model intricate quality variations across different fingerprint samples. Unlike traditional methods, our approach is database-agnostic, requiring no parameter tuning, thus offering a more adaptable and accurate solution for fingerprint quality assessment. By providing a fingerprint image dataset explicitly labeled by quality, this work establishes a solid foundation for future advancements in fingerprint image quality analysis and biometric applications.

                         <p>The quality of fingerprint images is a critical factor in the reliability of Automatic Identification Systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of ensuring high-quality data, free from uncertainty, in Fingerprint-based Automatic Identification Systems by introducing innovative possibilistic models and constructing a comprehensive database with ground truth on fingerprint image quality. Leveraging recent advancements in No-Reference Fingerprint Image Quality Assessment methods and utilizing benchmark datasets, labeled by person identity, our contributions include constructing a database labeled by image quality and introducing a two-level abstraction approach for fingerprint image quality modeling. The first level employs local quality indicators modeled using possibility distributions, which are then analyzed using possibilistic quality indicators in the second level. Possibility distributions, a key concept in possibility theory, are a well-established method for representing uncertain knowledge. Our contributions encompass the introduction of discriminative quality indicators, a sensitivity-aware feature selection process, and a benchmark package for the biometric community. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our modeling approach, demonstrating its ability to classify fingerprint images into two quality classes, namely, good and bad, while capturing intricate nuances of different quality levels. Unlike conventional fingerprint image quality assessment methods, this pioneering framework can be applied across different databases without the need for parametrization, providing a more nuanced and accurate representation of fingerprint image quality.</p>

                         <h5>Optimal feature subset deduction based on possibilistic feature 
quality classification and feature complementarity</h5>
                         <p>Data quality estimation has become an important research axis in applications when defining useful information is required. Determining useful information is an essential task in the learning process. One important aspect thereby is to find optimal and sufficient information that has a good quality and which is complimentary to improve the performance of the decision-making system. In this paper, a survey of data quality is operated in the possibilistic framework. The main objective of this work is the development of a possibilistic approach that aims to extract useful information from imperfect knowledge. The new method consists of two main steps, the classification of feature quality and the determination of the optimal feature subset. The optimal feature subset is deduced according to the feature classification technique and the feature complementarity. To show the performance of the proposed approach, the new method has been evaluated, firstly, on a synthetic dataset, and then on different benchmark databases. Later, the new method is evaluated on two real databases to gain a better insight into the performance of this method. Experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting useful information using the optimal feature subset. Experimental results illustrate significant accuracy rates compared with different earlier methods, especially when the system complexity increases.

                        <h5>Two No-Reference Image Quality Assessment methods based on Possibilistic Choquet Integral and Entropy: Application to Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems</h5>
                        <p>Quickly assessing image quality and rejecting poor-quality images can substantially improve current biometric systems. The main idea behind our proposed context-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) approaches is to offer an alternative to learning by using contextual information (domain knowledge). This is achieved by using a set of Contextual Quality Indicators (CQIs) and transforming them into Quality Assessment Criteria (QAC). Proper transforming ways are via the Possibilistic Choquet Integral (PCI) and Possibilistic Entropy (PE). The choice of the CQIs to be used is based on a priori analysis of the Context of application. We use ‘fingerprint’ as the context of application. The performance of an Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) is impacted by poor-quality fingerprint images. The main advantage of our context-based approaches over other IQA methods is that it requires no learning stage, use only four statistical CQIs, and can act very early in the processing chain (i.e., on raw images) to reject quickly poor-quality images so that the subsequent AFIS can process only good-quality images, which result in better recognition rate (RR) performance. The functioning of two methods (PCI, PE) is illustrated using image samples from PolyUHRF database. The performance of over two proposed NR-IQA (PCI, PE) is compared with two well known learning-based NR-IQA methods (NIQE, SSEQ) and the well known Fingerprint-IQA (F-IQA) methods (NFIQ, RPS, OCL, GaborShen, Gabor, RVU and FDA). Four experimental Data sets, FVC2000, FVC2002, FVC2004 and FVC2006, have been used to make the comparison. The results obtained with the context-based approaches compare favorably with those obtained with learning-based methods for fingerprint domain of applications.</p>

                        <h5>Two Image Quality Assessment Methods Based on Evidential Modeling and Uncertainty: Application to Automatic Iris Identification Systems</h5>
                        <p>The performance of an Automatic iris Identification System is impacted by both the poor quality of iris images and the uncertainty of information. Assessing image quality and rejecting poor-quality images can substantially improve the performances of the current biometric systems. The main idea behind our proposed Image Quality Assessment approaches is to take advantage, firstly, of the texture of iris images and, secondly, of the uncertainty of these information. This is achieved by defining a set of Contextual Quality Indicators extracted from the image texture and transforming them into Quality Assessment Criteria in the evidential framework, taking into account the information uncertainty degree. The Contextual Quality Indicators are defined based on a priori analysis of the context of the application. We use ‘iris’ as the context of application. Generally, only the normalized iris image is saved, i.e. the acquired iris image is not always available. So, the main advantage of our approaches over other related methods is that it can act in the normalization level of the processing chain to reject poor-quality images. So that, the subsequent Automatic iris Identification System can process only good-quality images, which result in better recognition rate performance. The functioning of our evidential approaches is illustrated using image samples from CASIA 1.0 database. The performance of over the proposed image quality assessment approaches is compared with the standard iris identification system without an image quality assessment step. A statistical test, based on 95% confidence interval, is used to assess if there is a statistically significant difference between the performances of the proposed approaches. The CASIA 1.0 has been used to make the comparison. The comparison results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for iris domain of applications.</p>

                        <h5>An Evidence Theory-Based Approach to Handling Conflicting Temporal Data in OWL 2</h5>
                        <p>Temporal data (TD) in Semantic Web are afected by diferent types of imperfections principally confict. In the literature, most of the proposed approaches deal with perfect TD. However, to our knowledge, there is no approach to dealing with conficting TD. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent and reason about quantitative conficting TD (i.e., time intervals and points) and associated qualitative relations (e.g., “before”). This approach is based on evidence theory and it is three folds. (i) For the representation, the mass function of the conficting temporal data is estimated, through the believability measures estimated based on our previous DBE_ALZ approach. Then, an ontology-based representation for the handled TD associated with the obtained mass function is proposed. (ii) For the reasoning, our approach relies on the Allen’s interval relations. First, we extend this algebra to reason about conficting temporal relations. The resulting interval relations preserve the properties of the original algebra. Second, we adapt the proposed relations to define new ones relating a time interval and a time point, and two time points. All the proposed relations can be used for temporal reasoning through transitivity tables. (iii) Based on (i) and (ii), we propose a new evidential ontology named “BeliefTimeOnto”. We implement a prototype to ease the interaction with the proposed ontology. We conduct two case studies: the frst is about temporal data entered by Alzheimer’s patients in the context of a memory prosthesis and the second is about data entered the context of Collective Memory application. The evaluation proves the usefulness of the proposed approach as all the inferences are well established and the precision results are interesting.</p>

                        <h5>Feature selection based on discriminative power under uncertainty for computer vision applications</h5>
                        <p>Feature selection is a prolific research field, which has been widely studied in the last decades and has been successfully applied to numerous computer vision systems. It mainly aims to reduce the dimensionality and thus the system complexity. Features have not the same importance within the different classes. Some of them perform for class representation while others perform for class separation. In this paper, a new feature selection method based on discriminative power is proposed to select the relevant features under an uncertain framework, where the uncertainty is expressed through a possibility distribution. In an uncertain context, our method shows its ability to select features that can represent and discriminate between classes.</p>

                        <h5>Electronic Embedded System for Stair Recognition Based on Possibilistic Modeling of Ultrasonic Signal</h5>
                        <p>Safe navigation is a common challenge for humans, as well as for mobile robots. Embedded devices offering autonomous navigation are increasingly required. To fulfill this requirement, various navigation systems have been proposed. Most of them are designed to avoid collisions with objects from the scene. However, some other obstacles, such as stairs, are posing a real danger and unfortunately, they did not attract sufficient attention to get a reliable and practical solution. In this paper, we propose a new electronic system for staircase detection and recognition based on ultrasonic (US) signals. The designed system can be used for indoor and outdoor applications to detect stairs and to recognize their nature (ascending or descending). The challenge here is to process in real-time a small sample size of an ultrasonic signal. Various features in time and frequency are used to characterize as much as possible the ultrasonic signals acquired for each of the two classes of stairs. Possibilistic models of the selected features are built for each class. The paper presents the electronic architecture, as well as the ultrasonic signal processing schemes for the stair recognitiontask. A rate of up to 93% is reached for staircase recognition using the proposed system.</p>

                        <h5>Possibilistic Similarity Measures for Data Science and Machin Learning Applications</h5>
                        <p>Measuring similarity is of a great interest in many research areas such as in data sciences, machine learning, pattern recognition, text analysis and information retrieval to name a few. Literature has shown that possibility is an attractive notion in the context of distinguishability assessment and can lead to very efficient and computationally inexpensive learning schemes. This paper focuses on determining the similarity between two possibility distributions. A review of existing similarity measures within the possibilistic framework is presented first. Then, similarity measures are analyzed with respect to their capacity to satisfy a set of required properties that a similarity measure should own. Most of the existing possibilistic similarity measures produce undesirable outcomes since they generally depend on the application context. A new similarity measure, called InfoSpecificity, is introduced and the similarity measures are categorized into three main methods: morphic-based, amorphic-based and hybrid. Two experiments are being conducted using four benchmark databases. The aim of the experiments is to compare the efficiency of the possibilistic similarity measures when applied to real data. Empirical experiments have shown good results for the hybrid methods, particularly with the InfoSpecificity measure. In general, the hybrid methods outperform the other two categories when evaluated on small-size samples, i.e., poor-data context (or poor-informed environment) where possibility theory can be used at the greatest benefit.

                        <h5>An intelligent quality-based approach to fusing multi-source possibilistic information</h5>
                        <p>Recently, Yager and Petry were proposing a quality-based methodology to combine data provided by multiple probabilistic sources to improve the quality of information for decision-makers. This paper offers a sort of companion paper that adapts this methodology to possibilistic sources. Possibility theory is particularly well suited to cope with incomplete information from poor-data sources. The methodology and algorithms used for the probabilistic approach are adapted for the possibilistic case. Both approaches are then compared by the means of a numerical example and four experimental benchmark datasets: one, the IRIS data set, being data-poorer than the three other ones (Diabetes dataset, Glass dataset and Liver-disorder dataset). A vector representation is introduced for a possibility distribution as in the probabilistic case and, the Gini’s formulation of entropy is being used. However, the Gini’s entropy has to be used differently than with the probabilistic case. This has an impact on the selection of subsets. A fusion scheme is designed to select the best-quality subsets according to two information quality factors: quantity of information and source credibility. Results obtained from comparison of both approaches on the four experimental benchmarks confirm the superiority of the possibilistic approach in the presence of information scarcity or incompleteness.</p>

                        <h5>Feature selection in possibilistic modeling</h5>
                        <p>Feature selection is becoming increasingly important for the reduction of computing complexity. In this context, conventional approaches have random performances, because They can succeed for some contexts and fail for others. Possibilistic modeling is a powerful paradigm being able to handle data imperfection or redundancy and is not affected by data variability. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new feature selection strategy for possibilitic modeling. The proposed approach is based on two issues in order to extract relevant features: the measure of feature importance as well as the possibility distribution uncertainty degree. The importance of one feature can be considered under two aspects: The first one is related to the scattering within one class and the second one reflects the feature power for class discrimination. Therefore, we apply, here, Shapley index paradigm which selects features who minimize the intra-class distance and who maximize the inter-class distance. The previous process is refined using possibility distribution uncertainty degree in order to resolve some conflict problems between feature׳s importance values.</p>
